        <h4>Who am I</h4>
        <p>My name is Vasyl Horbachenko, citizen of Ukraine, and you may know me for following projects:</p>

        </ul>
        <p>
          On 24 of February Russia has launched a full-scale war on Ukraine. Ukraine has been on track towards a better future, but Moscow just can't take that, drawing us back into authoritarianism and corruption.
          While the forces retreated from the north, now an attack on the east is pending.
        </p>
        <p>
          Liberated territories have seen the true means of russian "denazification" - mass graves, streets littered with bodies, and basements filled with dead people with tied arms. All civilians, of course.
        </p>

        <p>
          Please support Ukraine. Ask your local government to support Ukraine. Because if we lose we will be heading towards the most brutal ethnic cleansing the world has seen in a while.
        </p>

        <h4>If you want to help</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>If you're an <b>Ukrainian</b>: you know what to do.</li>
          <li>If you're a <b>Russian</b>: initially here was a plea for Russians to protest, but now I don't see them as the victims of the Putin regime anymore. I've seen numerous posts and videoblogs from genuine Russians supporting the offensive and spewing hate towards Ukrainians or simply retelling the state propaganda.</li>
          <li>If you're a <b>westener</b>: ask your local governments to support Ukraine. This is the only way to stop Russian threat to world peace. Make petitions, protest at Russian embassies, make your government known that you're not okay with what's happening.</li>

        <h4>If you don't care about politics</h4>
        <p>You are the reason this happened. Too many people in Russia and around the world simply didn't care. I was the same until recently. As my father used to say to me - <i>either you take interest in politics or politics start taking interest in you</i>.</p>
