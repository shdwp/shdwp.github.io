        <h4>Who am I</h4>
        <p>My name is Vasyl Horbachenko, citizen of Ukraine, and you may know me for following projects:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="https://github.com/shdwp/xivpartyicons">PartyIcons</a> and <a href="https://github.com/shdwp/xivFaderPlugin">FaderPlugin</a> Final Fantasy XIV plugins (looking for maintainers, contact at <i>vh#3401</i>).</li>

        </ul>
        <p>
          On 24 Feb Russia has launched a full-scale war on Ukraine. Ukraine has been on track towards a better future, but Moscow just can't take that, drawing us back into authoritarianism and corruption. 
          They are now threatening the world with nuclear war if more countries join NATO, an alliance that was made explicitly to defend from Moscow threats.

          Please support Ukraine. Please ask your local governments to support Ukraine. Please do something, because otherwise, we will not have a country we can call our own anymore.
        </p>

        <h4>If you want to help</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>If you're an <b>Ukrainian</b>: you know what to do.</li>
          <li>If you're a <b>Russian</b>: go out and protest. Your inability to do so resulted in the whole situation. Freedom is not a right but a privilege, and you didn't fight for yours for far too long.</li>
          <li>If you're a <b>westener</b>: ask your local governments to support Ukraine. This is the only way to stop Russian threat to world peace. Make petitions (you already had some success with SWIFT on this), protest at russian embassy, make your government known that you're not okay with what's happening.</li>

          <li>A huge list of donation addresses and charities <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ukraine/comments/s6g5un/want_to_support_ukraine_heres_a_list_of_charities/">on reddit</a>. Ukrainian army accepts donations even in BTC.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>If you don't know much about the war</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>This is not a localized conflict anymore, Russia attacked Ukraine from south, east and north, bombing all of it's major cities (as far back as 60km from Poland border).</li>
          <li>It's forbidden to spread any information about the war in Russia, apart from officially provided. They're still calling it a peacekeeping operation, hiding all of the losses and leaving Russian bodies out in the open.</li>

        </ul>

        <h4>If you don't care about politics</h4>
        <p>You are the reason this happened. Too many people in Russia and around the world simply didn't care. I was the same until recently. As my father used to say - <i>either you take interest in politics or politics start taking interest in you</i>.</p>

        <h4>If you don't believe that full scale war is happening</h4>
        <ul>
