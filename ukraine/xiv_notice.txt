On 24 Feb Russia launched a full-scale war on Ukraine to forcefully bring the country back into its sphere of influence and take control over its natural resources.
Liberated territories have seen the true means of Russian "denazification" - mass graves, streets littered with bodies, and basements filled with dead people with tied arms. This is nothing new for us - we've been occupied by Russians multiple times throughout history (USSR being the most notable example), so we can imagine the brutality of ethnic cleansing that will follow if Ukraine falls.
