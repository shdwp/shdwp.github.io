A year ago Russia has launched a full-scale invasion of my home country of Ukraine. Their propaganda moves the goalposts of the invasion reasons every 3 months, while continuously participating in victim-blaming of the country that they started the war against. With now the Russian opposition seemingly dead in the waters, the only hope for a better Ukraine now is continious Bloc support. I want to thank everyone who continues to do so.
