The author of this plugin is from Ukraine. 
On 24 Feb Russia has launched a full-scale war on Ukraine. Ukraine has been on track towards a better future, but Moscow just can't take that, drawing us back into authoritarianism and corruption. 
They are now threatening the world with nuclear war if more countries join NATO, an alliance that was made explicitly to defend from Moscow threats.
Please support Ukraine.
Oh, and plugin is looking for maintainers, for obvious reasons.
